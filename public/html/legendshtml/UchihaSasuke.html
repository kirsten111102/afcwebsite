            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Pure genius of the Uchiha Clan, little brother of Uchiha Itachi - Team Anime's coach, one of the most handsome and skillful player when he appears on the pitch. A cool-headed guy whether the match situations were good or bad.</p>
            <p>Like his brother, analysis and decision-making are strengths when he participate on the pitch. Combine with his skills of playing football, he usually makes a clutch at the end of the match or perform his skills to make the defenders confuse and don't know what move he will do next.</p>

            <h2>Teammate Thoughts</h2>
            <q>Used to be my frienemy when we were young, I knew his abilities are the things that only genius can have. He is the reason why I keep hard-working although sometimes in the past we did have a lot of arguments but I understood that he just wanted to keep him and the team better for competing in major trophies. As a teammate, I appreciate him a lot for appearing in this team. Without him, we would never achieve anything for the club.</q>

            <q>Sasuke is one of the best players that I have honored to work with. Since I left the team for new challenges, although I have claimed many trophies, have a lot of good students, he just one of a kind. Like he is special from other players with his skills and his mindset.</q>
