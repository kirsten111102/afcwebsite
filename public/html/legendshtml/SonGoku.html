                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>In 2015, when no one thought about a team can overturn <em>Naruto</em>'s empire, he with Vegeta and Gotenks appeared and had participated in one of the best matches in the AFC Manga League and take the king's crown in a very persuasive way. A year later, his team had created history not for only them but change the history of AFC Manga League, by proving they can beat the best team in that moment, Horans the Snitzels. Although had gone through ups and downs, he was considered one of the best players from the Asian League and till now, this fact doesn't change at all.</p>
                <p>Like <a href="UzumakiNaruto.html" class="namelink">Naruto</a>, he is an all-round player, but with his wonderful physicality, he had swept all the best defences and obstacles to achieve his dreams.</p>

                <h2>Teammate Thoughts</h2>
                <q>We had a fight together to decide who is the best in this team, but after all these years fighting with him in the same pitch, I have to admit that he is the best player of all time.</q>
                <p>- <a href="Vegeta.html" class="namelink">Vegeta</a> -</p>
                <q>With him in the team, I can fully concentrate to do my best at goalkeeping, because he and <a href="Vegeta.html" class="namelink">Vegeta</a> can do the rest of the work to help the team win.</q>
                <p>- <a href="Gotenks.html" class="namelink">Gotenks</a> -</p>
                <q>When I was famous because of my saving and catching skills in the Internet, I was very worried and could not cool my heads off at that moment, but thanks to him for giving me advices and boosting my mentality, I can play the football type I want till now.</q>
